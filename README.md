# AIL-test

### About this repo

At the outset, the repository was designed with two architectural plans for these services: plan A and plan B.

For plan A, the plan was to have two subsidiary services:
1. **fetcher** - Responsible for reading on-chain Ethereum data from each UniSwapv3 pool, converting decimal data, calculating what is needed for APY computation, and storing this information in a PostgreSQL database.
2. **api** - This service will encompass the endpoints GET `/apy`, POST `/pool`, and DELETE `/pool`. Each endpoint serves the following purpose:
   2.1 `/apy` - Takes a pool address from the query string to retrieve data from the database and calculate the 24-hour APY.
   2.2 POST, DELETE - These are APIs for CREATING and DELETING data in the database.

Plan B is similar to plan A but with a key difference in planA point 1, instead of reading data directly from the rpc chain, it changes to read data from a graphql endpoint at `https://api.thegraph.com/`.

During initial implementation, there were issues with calculating decimals and the APY formula, which led to the adoption of plan B. Data from thegraph is provided in a more summarized form, making it preferable.

The workflow of these two services is as follows:
- The **fetcher** is tasked with pulling different pool data, sourcing addresses from the database table `pool_address` and using go routines to pull historical data in 30-day increments (to accumulate data for APY calculation), storing the relevant information in the `pool_state` table.
- The **api** (describing only the GET /apy part) will query `pool_state` using the pool address from the query string, requesting data from the past 365 days (364 days before the request date to the request date itself).

### FYI : after docker-compose up , please waiting 1-2 minute for setup and fetch data
